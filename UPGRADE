UPGRADING FROM v1.1.x TO v1.2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several things have changed that can break compatibility with previous versions
of ColorBox. 

Most parameter names have been changed to be more consistent and intuitive for
new users - the old names were unnecessarily verbose.  Check the API for detail
on this.  'fixedWidth' and 'fixedHeight' are now just 'width' and 'height'. 

All element id's have been changed to be more consistent and to reduce the
chance of id conflicts.  All ColorBox DOM elements are now divs to prevent the
user's default styles (for anchors and paragraphs and such) from causing
unintentional conflicts.  This will also allow users to inject HTML into
elements like the 'close' or 'title' div, while remaining semantically valid.

The colorbox.css file has been removed - it's styles have been combined with the
jquery.colorbox.js file, as colorbox.css really wasn't large enough to warrant
being a separate file.  All user stylesheets have been upgraded, as have a
portion of the graphics.
