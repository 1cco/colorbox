## About Colorbox:
A customizable lightbox plugin for jQuery.  See the [project page](http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/) for documentation and a demonstration, and the [FAQ](http://jacklmoore.com/colorbox/faq/) for solutions and examples to common issues.  Released under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

## Colorbox 2.x vs 1.x

Internally, Colorbox 2.x is drastically different from 1.x.  However, the API is mostly the same as before.  A few options have been renamed or made obsolete, and IE7 support has been dropped. The most notable change is that Colorbox is no longer in the jQuery.fn namespace.

1.x way of assigning Colorbox:

	$('selector').colorbox(options);

2.x way of assigning Colorbox:

	$.colorbox('selector', options);
